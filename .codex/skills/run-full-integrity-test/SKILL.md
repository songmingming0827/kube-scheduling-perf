description: Run one complete eight-scenario kube-scheduling-perf benchmark on the resident server cluster, restore the idle baseline with make down, and publish the generated results with a timestamped full_test_report_MMDDHH.md in one commit. Use when the user asks to run a complete/full/integrity benchmark test or generate its report.

# Run Full Integrity Test

## Environment

- Local repository: `/Users/csmvic/Downloads/volcano-versions/kube-scheduling-perf`
- Server repository: `/root/github/kube-scheduling-perf`
- Read `CLUSTER_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD.md` before operating the cluster.
- Use `$volcano-benchmark-server` from `.codex/skills/volcano-benchmark-server/` to connect, and do not expose credentials, kubeconfig contents, Secrets, or tokens.

## 1. Prepare

1. Require the local repository to be on `master`, clean, and fully pushed to `origin/master`.
2. Require the server repository to have no tracked changes, then fast-forward it to `origin/master`.
3. Record the CST start time immediately before creating the server session.
4. Name the report `full_test_report_MMDDHH.md` using the start month, day, and hour. Example: `2026-08-12 09:23:10` becomes `full_test_report_081209.md`.
5. If that report name already exists, append the first available numeric suffix: `_2`, `_3`, and so on. Never overwrite an existing report.
6. Create a unique temporary working directory under `/tmp/` and a unique `tmux` session name using the full start timestamp.

## 2. Execute

Copy this Skill's `scripts/run-full-test.sh` into the temporary working directory, mark it executable, and launch that copy in a detached `tmux` session. Pass the server repository and temporary working directory as arguments.

The wrapper performs the following work:

- Removes only the repository result staging paths `tmp/result-staging`, `tmp/result-kueue-staging`, `tmp/result-volcano-staging`, and `tmp/result-yunikorn-staging` before the top-level `make` and after `make down`, including failed runs. Do not remove other repository `tmp/` content.
- Runs one top-level `make` and saves a CST-timestamped console log.
- Saves the tested Commit and the start/end times.
- Records result manifests before and after the run.
- Preserves the `make` exit code.
- Runs `make down` after `make` finishes, including when `make` fails, and saves its exit code.
- Writes a completion marker.

Monitor the completion marker so an SSH or network interruption does not interrupt or restart the test. If the wrapper terminates without a completion marker and no test process remains, run one manual `make down`, record the recovery, and end the run without restarting the full test.

## 3. Evaluate

Use the temporary logs, exit-code files, result manifests, and `results/scenario-N` metadata. A run passes only when:

- `make` exits `0`.
- `24/24` `TestBatchJob` cases pass with no failures or timeouts.
- All eight scenario directories are updated and contain `envs.txt` and `result-window.txt`.
- `make down` exits `0` and all experiment resources are removed.
- All scheduler components and Audit Exporter return to the fixed one-replica idle baseline.

A missing or failed `job-submission.png` is recorded but does not fail an otherwise successful test.

Derive each scenario's CST boundary from the timestamped start of its `make serial-test` command to the next scenario boundary, using the end of top-level `make` for scenario 8. Read the exact metric window from its `result-window.txt`.

## 4. Create the report

Create the report in the server repository root with exactly these sections:

```markdown
# 完整性测试报告（通过或失败）

## 1. 执行概要

## 2. 八个场景的时间边界与结果目录

## 3. 问题说明

## 4. 最终结论
```

### 执行概要

Record the tested Commit, command, `tmux` session, CST start/end in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`, precise duration, both exit codes, passed Case count, updated scenario count, and overall status.

### 八个场景的时间边界与结果目录

Use this table:

| 场景 | 模式与参数 | CST（UTC+8）时间边界 | 耗时 | 指标时间窗（毫秒） | 结果目录 | 结果 |

Use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` timestamps. Mark scenarios not produced by the current run as `未执行` or `未更新`.

### 问题说明

If no issue occurred, state that no problem affecting the conclusion was found. Otherwise record the symptom, supported direct cause, impact, and evidence location. Distinguish non-blocking image failures from test failures. Leave source repair or another full run for a separate user request.

### 最终结论

State `通过` or `失败` and summarize the eight scenarios, 24 Cases, and idle-baseline restoration.

## 5. Publish and clean up

After creating the report:

1. Run `git add -A -- results <current-report-name>`.
2. Confirm every staged path is under `results/` or is the current report.
3. Commit both as `results: full test MMDDHH` and push `master`.
4. Fast-forward the local repository.
5. Confirm the repository result staging paths named above are absent, then delete the server temporary working directory after its evidence has been incorporated into the report.

## 6. Return

Return the overall result, report path, combined publication commit, and any non-blocking anomaly.
