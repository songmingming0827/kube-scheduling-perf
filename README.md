# Kubernetes Scheduling Performance Benchmark

A comparative benchmark framework for Kueue, Volcano, and Apache YuniKorn. It runs the same batch workloads serially on a resident Kind + KWOK cluster, isolates scheduler components between runs, and collects API Server audit metrics and Grafana panels into timestamped result directories.

## Resident Kind Cluster

This is the supported execution mode. The framework reuses an already provisioned cluster; it does not create or delete a Kind cluster.

### Prerequisites

- A healthy resident cluster matching [CLUSTER_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD.md](CLUSTER_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD.md)
- Docker, Make, curl, and jq
- Cluster-admin access through `KUBECONFIG`
- The configured `kubectl` binary and resident deployment bundle
- Enough capacity for 1000 KWOK nodes and the monitoring stack; the validated baseline uses at least 16 CPU cores and should have at least 32 GiB memory

The validated defaults are:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Kind cluster | `volcano-benchmark-1348` |
| Kubernetes | `v1.34.8` |
| Nodes | 1 control-plane + 1000 KWOK nodes |
| Kubeconfig | `/root/benchmark-1348-deploy/kubeconfig` |
| kubectl | `/root/benchmark-1348-deploy/bin/kubectl` |
| Deployment bundle | `/root/benchmark-1348-deploy` |

Validated component versions:

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `v0.32.0` |
| Kubernetes / kubectl | `v1.34.8` |
| KWOK | `v0.7.0` |
| Volcano | `v1.15.1` |
| Kueue | `v0.19.0` |
| Scheduler Plugins / Coscheduling | Scheduler `v0.34.7`; Controller `v0.34.7-qpsfix` |
| Apache YuniKorn | `v1.9.0` |
| kube-prometheus-stack | `88.1.3` |

Override `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME`, `KUBECONFIG`, `KUBECTL`, or `RESIDENT_DEPLOY_DIR` when using an equivalent resident deployment at different paths.

The control-plane kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager both use CPU request/limit `500m/8` and Kubernetes client QPS/Burst `1000/1000`. The Controller image is based on the official `v0.34.7` tag with upstream QPS/Burst fix `4cd26c48`; no dependency version was upgraded.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Validate the resident cluster and build the three test binaries.
make up

# Run all eight benchmark scenarios against all three scheduler stacks.
make

# Recover from an interrupted run and converge to the resident replica baseline.
make down
```

`make up` only validates the existing cluster, schedulers, and monitoring stack. `make down` removes benchmark resources and converges all scheduler components and the Audit Exporter to one replica; it does not delete the cluster, rewrite scheduler ConfigMaps, or remove archived results.

### Step-by-Step

#### 1. Validate the Baseline

```bash
make up
```

The command verifies the resident Kubernetes cluster, all scheduler components, and monitoring, then compiles the Kueue, Volcano, and YuniKorn test binaries in a Go container.

#### 2. Run One Scenario

```bash
make serial-test \
  QUEUES_SIZE=1 \
  JOBS_SIZE_PER_QUEUE=500 \
  PODS_SIZE_PER_JOB=20 \
  GANG=false \
  TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=200
```

Each `serial-test` run executes Kueue, Volcano, and YuniKorn in that order. Before every scheduler test, the framework runs only the target stack and resets the Audit Exporter with the target scheduler label. `TestInit` creates or updates the Volcano and YuniKorn ConfigMaps only when their content differs and restarts the corresponding scheduler only after such a change. After each test all eight scheduler components return to one replica, while the latest experiment configuration and Audit Exporter label remain in place.

For Kueue, `GANG=false` uses the default Kubernetes scheduler and `GANG=true` uses Coscheduling. Volcano and YuniKorn use their native schedulers in both modes.

#### 3. Run the Full Matrix

```bash
make
```

The default target runs these eight scenarios:

| Scenario | Mode | Jobs | Pods per job | Total pods |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | Non-Gang | 10000 | 1 | 10000 |
| 2 | Non-Gang | 500 | 20 | 10000 |
| 3 | Non-Gang | 20 | 500 | 10000 |
| 4 | Non-Gang | 1 | 10000 | 10000 |
| 5 | Gang | 10000 | 1 | 10000 |
| 6 | Gang | 500 | 20 | 10000 |
| 7 | Gang | 20 | 500 | 10000 |
| 8 | Gang | 1 | 10000 | 10000 |

The complete matrix contains 24 `TestBatchJob` cases.

#### Run a Custom Single-Scheduler Scenario

`scenario-custom` reuses the same prepare, test, metrics, cleanup, and result-saving flow as the numbered scenarios, but runs exactly one scheduler and does not generate a relative Dashboard. Its defaults run the Volcano Batch Scheduler with 50 Jobs, 16 task replicas per Job, and non-Gang scheduling:

```bash
make scenario-custom
```

All custom defaults can be overridden from the command line. For example:

```bash
make scenario-custom \
  SCHEDULERS=volcano \
  VOLCANO_MODE=batch \
  JOBS_SIZE_PER_QUEUE=100 \
  PODS_SIZE_PER_JOB=8 \
  GANG=true \
  TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
```

The result is written to `results/scenario-custom/` and replaces the previous custom result. Numbered scenario results are not modified. `SCHEDULERS` must contain exactly one of `kueue`, `volcano`, or `yunikorn`.

The latest validated run completed all 24 cases successfully in `44m51.248s` (`2026-08-11 12:05:35` to `2026-08-11 12:50:26` CST). Audit Exporter and the Grafana dashboards used a `100ms` sampling/query step, and all 24 Prometheus capture barriers passed. Exact scenario and scheduler timestamps are recorded in [RESIDENT_CLUSTER_FULL_TEST_REPORT.md](RESIDENT_CLUSTER_FULL_TEST_REPORT.md#21-100ms-采集与单相对面板归档完整测试通过).

#### 4. View Results

Every scenario writes to a stable directory and replaces the previous run of the same scenario:

```text
results/
└── scenario-<1..8>/
    ├── envs.txt
    ├── result-window.txt
    └── job-submission.png
```

The persistent Grafana endpoint is:

```text
http://<benchmark-server>:31005/grafana/d/perf/?theme=light
```

The persistent endpoint is the standard Dashboard access path; no local SSH forwarding Skill is required.

#### 5. Recover an Interrupted Run

```bash
make down
```

Use this when a scheduler run is interrupted. The target enables all scheduler components and the Audit Exporter at one replica, cleans all benchmark resources, waits for the fixed replica baseline, and verifies the base cluster. It does not require saved resident state.

## Benchmark Parameters

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `QUEUES_SIZE` | `1` | Number of benchmark queues |
| `JOBS_SIZE_PER_QUEUE` | `1` | Jobs created in each queue |
| `PODS_SIZE_PER_JOB` | `1` | Pods created by each job |
| `CPU_REQUEST_PER_POD` | `1` | CPU request per pod |
| `MEMORY_REQUEST_PER_POD` | `1Gi` | Memory request per pod |
| `CPU_PER_QUEUE` | `10000` | Queue CPU capacity |
| `MEMORY_PER_QUEUE` | `10000Gi` | Queue memory capacity |
| `GANG` | `false` | Enable gang scheduling semantics |
| `PREEMPTION` | `false` | Enable preemption scenarios |
| `TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `3600` | Go test timeout for one scheduler case |
| `CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `600` | Maximum confirmation wait for Kueue namespaced cleanup |

Additional impacting and critical workload variables are defined at the top of the [Makefile](Makefile).

## Existing Cluster

Generic existing-cluster support is not implemented. The current Makefile assumes the resident cluster has the namespaces, CRDs, scheduler Deployments, Audit Exporter, Prometheus, Grafana, and verification scripts documented in [CLUSTER_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD.md](CLUSTER_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD.md). Another cluster can be used only after providing an equivalent deployment and overriding the resident paths; this is not a portable bootstrap workflow yet.

## Reference

### Scheduler Stacks

| Stack | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Kueue | Kueue Controller, default kube-scheduler for non-Gang tests, Coscheduling Scheduler and Controller for Gang tests |
| Volcano | Volcano Batch Scheduler, Agent Scheduler, Controllers, and Admission |
| YuniKorn | YuniKorn Scheduler and Admission Controller |

### Metrics

The customized `kube-apiserver-audit-exporter` reads API Server audit events and exports scheduler-labelled Prometheus metrics. Its YuniKorn workload counter correlates Controller Manager Pod creation with binding events so placeholder Pods are excluded without subtracting unrelated counters. The Grafana `perf` Dashboard compares scheduling latency, API call totals and rates, pods scheduled, and batch jobs completed across the three scheduler stacks.

The resident API Server audit file is still reset between scheduler runs and consumed by Audit Exporter, but it is no longer copied into result directories. Prometheus metrics and the relative Job Submission panel are the benchmark outputs.

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Open Files

On Linux, increase inotify limits when the host reports `Too many open files`:

```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=655360 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1280 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```
